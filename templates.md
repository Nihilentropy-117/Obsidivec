# Being afraid of shadows is all part of us...

Being afraid of shadows is all part of us becoming more intelligent. I think your mind is working out that there's a you and there's also everything outside you. So now you're not just frightened of things that you can see and hear and smell, but also of things that you can sort of see inside your head. Learning to face the shadows outside helps us to fight the shadows inside, and you can control all the darkness. It's a big step forward.
